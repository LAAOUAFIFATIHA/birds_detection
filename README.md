## Description

This project uses a **Raspberry Pi** and **Arduino** to detect birds in real-time using a camera. The Raspberry Pi processes the camera feed to detect birds using a pre-trained machine learning model, and the Arduino is used to trigger actions (e.g., activating a servo motor or LED) when a bird is detected.

## Features

- Real-time bird detection using a camera.
- Integration with Arduino for physical actions (e.g., servo motor, LED).
- Lightweight and efficient for edge devices like Raspberry Pi.
- Customizable detection threshold and actions.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (with camera module)
- Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Servo motor or LED (for action triggering)
- Jumper wires and breadboard
- Power supply for both Raspberry Pi and Arduino

## Software Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow Lite (for lightweight bird detection)
- Arduino IDE
- `pyserial` library for Raspberry Pi-Arduino communication

## Installation

### Raspberry Pi Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-pip
   pip3 install tensorflow pyserial
